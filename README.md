# IdealistaProject
This project contains the pricing for the properties in 3 cities - Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona.
The datasets provide the pricing fo assets based on several parameters about the property and its surroundings.
In the Python code, we've performed Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and various machine learning models trained and tested that help predict the price of an asset based on the other features.
The folder Idealista DS contains the Datasets of the assets for each of the three cities.
It also contains the neighbourhoods in terms of the geographical coordinates in a city, the health centres and the education institutions for each city.
